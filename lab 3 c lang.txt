QUESTION #01:

Problem description: the variable testInteger is initialised with a value of 3000000000 and then printf function is used to display this value.
However, the output value is -1294967296.

Solution: In c lang the int data type can store 32bits (4 BYTES) usually. 3000000000 exceeds this limit and overflow occurs resulting in
unexpected negative number.
Use data type long long int or unsigned int to print this value of, 3000000000.

QUESTION #02:

#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
  int a,b,c; // Declare three integer variables
  printf("Enter two numbers:");
  scanf("%d %d",&a, &b);
  // Swaping the two numbers
  c = a;
  a = b;
  b = c;
  printf("Both numbers swapped: %d %d\n",a, b); // Displaying both the numbers after swapping
  return 0;
} //end main



QUESTION #03:

#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
  int salary;// Declare a variable as int data type
  float tax_rate;// Declare a variable as float data type
  float tax_payable; // Variable to store tax user has to pay as float data type
  float salary_left; // Variable to store remaining salary of user as float data type
  printf("Enter your salary and tax rate: \n");
  scanf("%d %f", &salary, &tax_rate);
  tax_payable = (tax_rate/100)*salary; //Calculating tax user has to pay
  salary_left = salary - tax_payable; // salary left after tax deduction
  printf("Tax you have to pay: %.2f\n", tax_payable);
  printf("Salary left after paying tax: %.2f", salary_left);
  return 0;

QUESTION #04:

#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
float fuel_avg, fuel_conA, fuel_conB, total_fuelCost, total_fuelCon; //Declare variables as float data type
do{
printf("Enter your car's fuel average: ");
scanf("%f",&fuel_avg);
} //end do-while
while (fuel_avg <= 0); // Repeat until value greater than 0
fuel_conA = 1207/fuel_avg; // fuel consumed during trip from A to B
fuel_conB = 1207/fuel_avg; // fuel consumed during trip from B to A
total_fuelCost = fuel_conA*118 + fuel_conB*123; //total fuel cost for the whole trip
total_fuelCon = fuel_conA + fuel_conB; //total fuel consumed during the complete trip
printf("Total fuel cost for whole trip: %.2f \n", total_fuelCost);
printf("Total fuel consumed for whole trip: %.2f", total_fuelCon);

QUESTION #06:

#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
int x1, x2, y1, y2; // Declare variables as integer
x1 = 5;
x2 = 3;
y1 = 4;
y2 = 2;
float slope = (y2-y1)/(x2-x1); // calculating slope between two points
printf("The slope of points (5,4) and (3,2) is %.3f: ", slope);
